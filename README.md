# GitHub Contributions

I actively contribute to my projects on GitHub by pushing code, creating branches, and merging features. Each commit I make counts as a contribution, which is tracked on my GitHub profile.  

## How Contributions Are Counted

- **Default Branch Pushes**: Commits pushed to `main` or `master` show up as contributions.  
- **Merged Branches**: Feature branches merged into the default branch also count.  
- **Correct Author Email**: Commits must use an email linked to my GitHub account.  
- **Private Repositories**: Contributions are counted if the visibility of private contributions is enabled in GitHub settings.  

## My Workflow

1. Create a branch for each feature or bug fix.  
2. Make incremental commits with clear messages.  
3. Push the branch to the repository.  
4. Open a pull request and merge it into the main branch.  

## Example

```bash
git checkout -b feature/navbar
git add .
git commit -m "Add animated navigation bar with Framer Motion variants"
git push origin feature/navbar
